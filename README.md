# CSCE 355 Project: Haskell Tester
A Haskell program to test submissions for the CSCE 355 DFA Project

Space is limited on the linux machines, so stack is not yet an option.
To get the required packages, the following is necessary:
    cabal update
    cabal install process
    cabal install directory
